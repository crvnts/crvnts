- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @crvnts, I'm a SWE co-op student at Toronto Metropolitan U, and a former Data and Applications Engineer at MHI RJ Aviation.
- I am currently a Project Manager for the Faculty of Engineer and Architectural Design at Toronto Metropolitan U, and a Scrum Master for CPS714 managing a 10-man Agile software Development team.
- My main interests are in Agile Development practices, software project management, product ownership, software design, front-end/UI engineering, and cross-platform application development!
- I am looking to build up my project portfolio to demonstrate my proficiency in the several different stacks, as well as solidify my tech stack knowledge in preparation to become an eloquent TPM.
